### Main code taken from youtube follow along: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0BofouWX-o&t=6027s

Then I added a few moderations and options.

To run just clone and run from the console using:
* javac ATM.java
* java ATM.java

Warning!
The app might not work if run through IDE (mainly due to password ).

To run from IDE:
* comment out line 58 in ATM class
* uncomment lines 59,60
